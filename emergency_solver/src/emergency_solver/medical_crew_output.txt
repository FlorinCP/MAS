The most suitable hospital for the emergency response team is Hospital 1, as it has a range of specialized medical personnel and equipment, including Paramedic Roberto Díaz, who is already on-scene. Hospital 1's staff includes Dr. Elena Rodríguez (orthopedics), Nurse Marcos Peña (ICU nursing), Psychologist Isabel Torres (trauma counseling), Paramedic Sergio López (emergency response), and Nurse Clara Gutiérrez (pediatric nursing). This team can provide comprehensive care for the emergency, including stabilization, transportation to a hospital, and follow-up care.
